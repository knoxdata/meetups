Familiarity will give future meetings more richness!</p> <p>A big thanks to local startup Cirruspath (cirrusinsight.com) for their generosity in providing space to host the first meeting.</p> <p>The preliminary agenda:</p> <p>• Snacks and drinks while everyone mingles and settles-in.</p> <p>• Short intro from the organizers to share vision for group.</p> <p>• Quick share from attendees about who they are, what they do, etc.</p> <p>• Discussion of, “to us, what is data science?” to help set the tone for future meetings.</p> <p>• All attendee chat about what the group wants to see at future meet-ups, e.g. keynote or lightning talks, free workshops, seminars, business highlights, MOOC study groups, a Kaggle team, wins/losses expose... bring your ideas.</p> <p>• Hammer out long-term logistics to maximize engagement: venue(s), best days/times for meetings, sponsorships.</p> <p>• Head to the Casual Pint for some brew.</p> ",

If you have something to cool to share, this is that the time to do it. Whether you're a business analyst, machine learner, or just enjoy a good dataviz, I hope that others will share something that interests you.

"description": "<p>Last month, a common theme among the room pertained to questions about managing a workflow when it comes to dealing with data - whether for science, for business intelligence, or for app development. KnoxData organizer, Alex Pawlowski, will talk a little bit about how he manages his workflow, inspired in large part by great resources like Hadley Wickham's R for Data Science book, and several Medium articles by data science teams at AirBnb + Uber. While the source of inspiration starts in R, good data organization, like this group, is highly language agnostic. He'll include some examples from industry that incorporate multiple languages as part of their workflows, using specific tools to manage their needs best. As this is purely one perspective, you are encouraged to talk about some of your experiences as well, and hopefully include some tools that are important for you.</p> <p>See you there! </p> <p>If there's sufficient interest, we'll walk across to finish conversations at Crafty Bastard 🍺</p> ",

"description": "<p>Project Jupyter is a growing ecosystem of free, open source scientific software for interactive computing, consisting of millions of users and over a million notebooks on GitHub. Jupyter's Notebook, and related experiences, are becoming standard interfaces for scientists and engineers. The notebook interface is impacting the broader landscapes of research, computing, and teaching where data and code are essential; the stakeholders span industry, academia, and philanthropy.</p> <p>This talk will review the history of Project Jupyter as scientific software born from the Scientific Python (SciPy) community. Since its inception, the community has extended Jupyter to work with over 50 different languages and provided new options for interactive development, research and presentation, including JupyterLab, the next generation of the Notebook. In the broader open source community we find Jupyter tools for grading, batch processing, app development, documentation, tests, and even source code.</p> <p>Within organizations, Jupyter notebooks are commonly used to exchange ideas and build knowledge bases across diverse disciplines. The talk will highlight recent case studies in Jupyter transforming classroom education, massive collaboration in physics, and the entire multimedia experience of learning.</p> <p>Tony Fast is a modern scientist with over a decade of experience analyzing unstructured data for cross functional teams in research, business, and security. He holds a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from Drexel University and has B.S. in Ceramic Engineering from Rutgers University. Tony currently explores the intersection of applied engineering and computer science, trying to understand how open access will transform basic science for the next generation workforce. Tony is actively building diverse communities around open source scientific software technologies in metro Atlanta. Tony currently organizes the Atlanta Jupyter User Group and is a data lead at Code for Atlanta; he was a co-founder of PyData Atlanta.</p> ",

"description": "<p>At the heart of our current AI Renaissance is a set of tools and techniques called deep learning. Over the past 5 years, advances in GPU hardware combined with deep learning and cloud computing have enabled significant advances in computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and recommendation systems that match or exceed human performance on similar tasks. However, the theory behind deep learning is much older, dating back to the neuroscience and artificial intelligence community of the 1960s and 1970s. This talk will review the history and the biological basis of artificial neural networks, and explore the similarities and differences between machine learning and learning in the brain. We will conclude with an overview of practical tips for deep learning that were inspired by our current (only slightly better) understanding of the brain.</p> <p>Nikhil Deshmukh is a data scientist and generalist problem solver who has applied his expertise to everything from embedded low-power computer vision for autonomous vehicles to predicting appointment no-shows for private health clinics and optimizing HR processes for Fortune 500 companies. Nikhil received his PhD in Neuroscience and Molecular Biology from Princeton University, where he studied the neural circuitry in the retina that converts light into electrical signals. Nikhil is also an advocate for reforming higher education in the sciences, and is actively involved in mentoring graduate students who are transitioning out of academia. He formerly co-hosted the PhD in Progress Podcast and helped organize science outreach programs and curricula for K-12 students.</p> ",

"description": "<p>In the past few meetups, we've delved more into neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. You've read the stories about smarter AI defeating the best human players in Chess, Go, and some video games, amongst others. You've also seen great neural networks turn into dumb things. As E-Sports have evolved, the level of complexity in game play has increased, and so have the stakes. Millions of dollars each year and ESPN (not just the Ocho) coverage have gone to covering the professional players who rack up the highest level of game play in a variety of games.</p> <p>OpenAI has spent the last few years developing a beast of five neural networks that slowly but surely has beaten some of the best humans in a tough game, called Dota.</p> <p>August 5th, OpenAI Five takes on the the top 99.95 percentile human players in a modified - but less so than previously - game of Dota 2.</p> <p>Join your fellow humans in Knoxville as we watch the origins of SkyNet evolve and defeat humans in game play. Maybe humans will survive this round and still be relevant.</p> <p>Regardless, we'll do what humans still do best: drink beer and eat food.</p> <p>Background of OpenAI Five: <a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/\" class=\"linkified\">https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/</a></p> <p>Details of the event: <a href=\"https://blog.openai.com/openai-five-benchmark/\" class=\"linkified\">https://blog.openai.com/openai-five-benchmark/</a></p> ",

They use Anaconda to get set up with Python, but Anaconda can also integrate well with other languages, like R.</p> <p>Their meetup is geared towards those that have never used Python or are just getting started. They will help you install Python on your computer so bring your Linux, Mac, or Windows laptop. This workshop will also give an overview of the Python ecosystem to help guide you on your Python journey.</p> ",

"description": "<p>Gauges, sensors, and IOT devices in industrial production facilities such as water treatment have been Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) used to measure and optimize performance. With modern data ingestion platforms and analytic solutions we can decrease the time between alarming KPI's and action, increase performance through increased optimization and reduce down-time by predicting failures before they occur. Working with a large water treatment company, Cloudreach implemented these performance improvements, and built a production environment that predicts rare cleaning events using historical device readings, institutional knowledge, and predictive analytics. Working with the subject matter experts within the clients' organization we identified the minimum number of sensors at sites within the portfolio to detect events, engineered features, and created an XGBoost logistic regression binary classification model for tagging events with a positive predictive value &gt;= 88% (Note the events have ~0.5% prevalence). From the tagged values, the Cloudreach team was able to create a Tableau dashboard to identify previously unavailable metrics and visualizations to reduce plant downtime at over 200 sites, more accurately allocate on-site resources, and provide additional information for process analysts.</p> <p>Brandon Bagley is a Data Scientist at Cloudreach. He obtained his Master's in Geology with a minor in Statistics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.</p> <p>He currently works at Cloudreach to provide machine learning solutions to customers who would like to leverage their big data to add value to their organization.</p> ",

"description": "<p>This is half of a dry-run for Chris Ostrouchov and I's (hai, this is Alex, organizer of KnoxData) Codestock talk this year about open data in Knoxville. For tonight's meetup, I will focus on the story of getting the data, organizing, organizing the data format, and some of the cool visuals you can do in jupyterlab in 2019 with a few other packages.</p> <p>Codestock Talk - Saturday 2019-04-13 12:40 PM - 1:40 pm</p> <p>Talk Abstract:</p> <p>Open Data to a lot of big city dwellers is the norm. Large local gov's maintain an impressive array of developers and data analysts to keep APIs up, data constantly updated, and even maintain select visualizations to let users take a cursory glance at city-held data. Local developers / policy analysts / entrepreneurs alike win with an easy to access source for information about their city, that they could use to add value to their projects. Local gov's win from an increased engagement from their citizens on the projects local gov's prioritize. For a small or even mid-sized city to realize these gains, titles to match the responsibilities of a robust open data system either don't exist or are held by just a few people. For a mid-sized city to get in the game, it takes a community to pitch a demonstrable why. For any good pitch, a set of good tools is needed. While notebooks can have their con's - we'll talk about them - recent developments in jupyterlab - an open JS-based framework - make analyses even more transparent and easy for interested citizens to get involved with their local gov. Because of jupyterlab's extension-first architecture, popular python visualization tools, like plotly, matplotlib, and leaflet, and non-python tools open up an incredible opportunity for seasoned pythonistas, new-to-python developers, or new coders to make sense of available data. Through jupyterlab, we'll take you on an exploration of simple data infrastructure, good warehousing techniques, and beginning an analysis with rapidly developing tools, using Knoxville as a backdrop for this change. We'll also cover some of the challenges in helping local gov's to make publicly available data open.</p> ",

"description": "<p>Text data is meaningful in many contexts, but can also be difficult to work with for machine learning because of its complexity and ambiguity. Until recently, the state of the art for natural language processing was to use word embeddings, converting each word to a fixed length vector that preserves the semantic meaning. This past year researchers have found that they could train general purpose deep language models and then apply these models in a variety of NLP tasks such as summarization, text classification, named entity recognition, question answering and many many more using transfer learning. This a watershed moment for NLP, on par with the impact of pre-trained deep neural classifiers for ImageNet that revolutionized the field of computer vision over the last 7 years.</p> <p>This talk will provide some historical context on embeddings and language modeling, as well as a demo of how to adapt a deep language model pretrained on millions of sentences from Wikipedia to perform sentiment analysis and intent classification with very small sets of novel training data.</p> <p>Nikhil Deshmukh is an independent data science consultant who has applied his expertise to everything from embedded low-power computer vision for autonomous vehicles, optimizing HR processes for Fortune 500 companies, and developing IoT solutions for precision agriculture in rural India. Nikhil received his PhD in Neuroscience and Molecular Biology from Princeton University, where he studied the neural circuitry in the retina that converts light into electrical signals.</p> <p>Cover photo from Arisoy, E., Sainath, T.
