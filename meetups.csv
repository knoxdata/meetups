Over the past 5 years, advances in GPU hardware combined with deep learning and cloud computing have enabled significant advances in computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and recommendation systems that match or exceed human performance on similar tasks. However, the theory behind deep learning is much older, dating back to the neuroscience and artificial intelligence community of the 1960s and 1970s. This talk will review the history and the biological basis of artificial neural networks, and explore the similarities and differences between machine learning and learning in the brain.

With modern data ingestion platforms and analytic solutions we can decrease the time between alarming KPI's and action, increase performance through increased optimization and reduce down-time by predicting failures before they occur. Working with a large water treatment company, Cloudreach implemented these performance improvements, and built a production environment that predicts rare cleaning events using historical device readings, institutional knowledge, and predictive analytics. Working with the subject matter experts within the clients' organization we identified the minimum number of sensors at sites within the portfolio to detect events, engineered features, and created an XGBoost logistic regression binary classification model for tagging events with a positive predictive value &gt;= 88% (Note the events have ~0.5% prevalence). From the tagged values, the Cloudreach team was able to create a Tableau dashboard to identify previously unavailable metrics and visualizations to reduce plant downtime at over 200 sites, more accurately allocate on-site resources, and provide additional information for process analysts.</p> <p>Brandon Bagley is a Data Scientist at Cloudreach.

For tonight's meetup, I will focus on the story of getting the data, organizing, organizing the data format, and some of the cool visuals you can do in jupyterlab in 2019 with a few other packages.</p> <p>Codestock Talk - Saturday 2019-04-13 12:40 PM - 1:40 pm</p> <p>Talk Abstract:</p> <p>Open Data to a lot of big city dwellers is the norm. Large local gov's maintain an impressive array of developers and data analysts to keep APIs up, data constantly updated, and even maintain select visualizations to let users take a cursory glance at city-held data. Local developers / policy analysts / entrepreneurs alike win with an easy to access source for information about their city, that they could use to add value to their projects. Local gov's win from an increased engagement from their citizens on the projects local gov's prioritize. For a small or even mid-sized city to realize these gains, titles to match the responsibilities of a robust open data system either don't exist or are held by just a few people. For a mid-sized city to get in the game, it takes a community to pitch a demonstrable why. For any good pitch, a set of good tools is needed. While notebooks can have their con's - we'll talk about them - recent developments in jupyterlab - an open JS-based framework - make analyses even more transparent and easy for interested citizens to get involved with their local gov. Because of jupyterlab's extension-first architecture, popular python visualization tools, like plotly, matplotlib, and leaflet, and non-python tools open up an incredible opportunity for seasoned pythonistas, new-to-python developers, or new coders to make sense of available data. Through jupyterlab, we'll take you on an exploration of simple data infrastructure, good warehousing techniques, and beginning an analysis with rapidly developing tools, using Knoxville as a backdrop for this change. We'll also cover some of the challenges in helping local gov's to make publicly available data open.</p> ",across the street from 🍻,public,true,1551919868000,5400000,259547016,Understanding Sentiment and Intent: Transfer learning for Natural Language,false,past,1555626600000,2019-04-18,18:30,1555637385000,-14400000,0,19,26080439,The Technology Cooperative,35.974674224853516,-83.92288970947266,false,13 Emory Pl,Knoxville,us,USA,37917,TN,1419436448000,KnoxData - a PyData group,18271914,open,35.93000030517578,-84.01000213623047,knoxdata,Data enthusiasts,"Knoxville, TN",TN,us,en_US,US/Eastern,https://www.meetup.com/knoxdata/events/259547016/,"<p>Text data is meaningful in many contexts, but can also be difficult to work with for machine learning because of its complexity and ambiguity. Until recently, the state of the art for natural language processing was to use word embeddings, converting each word to a fixed length vector that preserves the semantic meaning. This past year researchers have found that they could train general purpose deep language models and then apply these models in a variety of NLP tasks such as summarization, text classification, named entity recognition, question answering and many many more using transfer learning. This a watershed moment for NLP, on par with the impact of pre-trained deep neural classifiers for ImageNet that revolutionized the field of computer vision over the last 7 years.</p> <p>This talk will provide some historical context on embeddings and language modeling, as well as a demo of how to adapt a deep language model pretrained on millions of sentences from Wikipedia to perform sentiment analysis and intent classification with very small sets of novel training data.</p> <p>Nikhil Deshmukh is an independent data science consultant who has applied his expertise to everything from embedded low-power computer vision for autonomous vehicles, optimizing HR processes for Fortune 500 companies, and developing IoT solutions for precision agriculture in rural India.
