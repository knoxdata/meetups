## Abstract

Over the past few years of KnoxData, we've flirted with some talks in the spatial realm of data, which has often necessitated special software and techniques. While those techniques still apply, Dr. Paulo Raposo, assistant professor in UT Geography, will give us a crash course in GDAL and open source QGIS with follow-along demos, aimed at an audience already familiar with general Python.
